# ist-visualizer

This app is an assistant to Meditation practitioners to be able to record written and visual documents for clients.

The templates of human bodies act as a base template for all clients and you are able to paint what you see energetically and store the image in the clients file to create a long term progression of the practioner and client's interactions over a course of time. 
A notes section is also added to be able to further the in-depth documents that are being created
